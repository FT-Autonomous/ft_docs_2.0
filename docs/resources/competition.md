# General Competition Info

Formula Student is the Europe‚Äôs most established educational automotive engineering competition that challenges university students from worldwide top to design, manufacture, build and test electric and combustion race cars following a strict set of rules that prioritize safety. These students are then challenged to race their cars and compete against other teams in international competitions. However, the competition is not won solely by the team with the fastest car, but rather by the team with the best overall package of construction, performance and financial and sales planning.

FS-AI (and FS in general) provides a fantastic opportunity to gain the skills and experience that are highly desired by those in the automotive industry (Formula Trinity alumni have gone on to work at places such as Jaguar Landrover, Williams Racing, Red Bull and more!).

We currently compete in Formula Student UK (FSUK) which takes place in July of every year.

There two different FS-AI classes: Automated Driving System (ADS) and Dynamic Driving Tast (DDT):

**ADS**: Teams compete with an autonomous car that they have developed and built completely themselves, such as previous competition entries from Starkstrom Augsburg and Team Bath Racing Electric. This is intended for experienced, multi-disciplined teams who are either developing existing FS cars to have driverless capabilities or vehicles they are building from scratch.

**DDT**: Teams can borrow the ADS ‚Äì Dedicated Vehicle  (ADS-DV), which has been developed exclusively for FS-AI. Teams then focus on selecting sensors and developing driving software that produces drive commands for the vehcile as opposed to designing their own vehicle from zero.
