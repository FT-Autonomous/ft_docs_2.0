# Introduction

The purpose of this doc is to serve as a point of reference regarding the Python programming language.   
If you have no prior programming experience, learn basic Python by writing simple programs and running them either by using the resources in this doc or any good resource, then how to use common functions in the numpy library and learn how & why it is different from regular Python. After this, you are set to start contributing to the codebase and pick up new things as necessary. Google search & Stack Overflow will be helpful. LLMs like Chat GPT & Claude are great for Python programming but **use documentation as a source of truth**.
