# Hardware


## Simulation

Yeah we dont do that here, unless you count solidworks

## Goals
### Genaral
- Create and maintain a working test rig 'Rigby'.
- Simulate a DDT car using Rigby.
- Design interchangeable sensor mount for DDT car and Rigby.
- Support rest of FT Autonomous with Hardware assistance.
### Current year (2024/2025)
- Improve steering solution to remove toe out geometry
- Redo electronics wiring
- Implement feedback sensors and PID control, and modular control systems (Arduinos and Jetson)

## Previous Implementations

### 2022/2023

Rigby was made summer 2023, so no Hardware work was done in this time period

### 2023/2024

- First pass at a steering improvement on rigby, changed motor
- First pass at electronics systems, steering angle feedback
