# Hardware

Hardware is the newest department to FT Autonomouts (as of Septermber 2025) and serves to build the autonomous test rig "Rigby" and to improve the sensor mount.

## Goals
### General
- Create and maintain a working test rig 'Rigby'.
- Simulate a DDT car using Rigby.
- Design interchangeable sensor mount for DDT car and Rigby.
- Support rest of FT Autonomous with Hardware assistance.
### Current year (2025/2026)
#### Electronics
- Implement potentiometer based control loop for steering system.
- Finalise and implement communication protocols for Jetson to Jetson, and Jetson to Arduino communtications.
- Integrate independant power supply for drive and steering motors onto rigby
#### Mechanical
- mount poteentiometer to Rigby for control of steering.
- Add a more permanant weatherproofing solution to the sensor mount
- Add mounting plate to Rigby, to give more space for onboard electronics and morot power supply

## Previous Implementations

### 2022/2023

Rigby was made summer 2023, so no Hardware work was done in this time period

### 2023/2024

- First pass at a steering improvement on rigby, changed motor
- First pass at electronics systems, steering angle feedback

### 2024/2025
- Improve steering solution to remove toe out geometry
- Redo electronics wiring
- Implement feedback sensors and PID control, and modular control systems (Arduinos and Jetson)
