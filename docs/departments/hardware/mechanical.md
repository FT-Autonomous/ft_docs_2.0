RIGBY GO VROOM (TO BE ADDED LATER)

## Lunchy

### Design Process Logs
*Documentation wasn't done on V1-V3*

#### LunchyV4
Lunchy 4 won't work as built, and new ideas need to be added at the beginning.
##### Why it won't work:
    - It looks hella ugly.
    - The vent should be split in 2 and moved to the sides. Hot air gathers more there, and for structural integrity 2 smaller ones are better.
    - Dimensions are wrong for the camera as this year we are switching from the Zed 2 to the Zed 2i

##### What needs to be added.
    - Sponsor wall
    - Change to z2i camera (and maybe make that mount a separate part).
    - Considering making an internal ribbed part holder.
