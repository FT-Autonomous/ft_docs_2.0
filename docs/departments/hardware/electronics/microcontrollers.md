# Microcontrollers
Microcontrollers are small computational devices such as an ESP32 or Arduino that can be used to interact with hardware through GPIO.
the following microcontrollers are currently used by hardware:
- Aduino Uno R4 WIFI
- Arduino Nano 33 IOT

## Arduino UNO R4 WIFI
the arduino UNO R4 WIFI (arduino UNO, or UNO) is a versatile arduino board with a 5V operating voltage that can be used for a wide range of purposes, etc etc (will insert more descriptive stuff from the website)

## Arduino Nano 33 IOT
the arduino Nano 33 IOT (arduino Nano, Nano) is a smaller arduino board with a 3.3V operating voltage focused on smaller, more IOT based use cases (more description to come)
